# Smart Campus Docker Management Commands

Here are the commands to verify, stop, and manage your Docker containers.

## 1. Check Running Containers
To see which containers are currently running and their ports:
docker ps

## 2. Stop Services
To stop all services and remove the containers:
docker-compose down

To stop a specific container (e.g., frontend):
docker stop smart-campus-app-frontend-1

## 3. Start Services
To start the services (in detached mode, so they run in background):
docker-compose up -d

To start services and see logs in the terminal:
docker-compose up

## 4. Rebuild Services
If you make code changes, rebuild the images:
docker-compose up --build

## 5. View Logs
To view logs for all services:
docker-compose logs -f

To view logs for a specific service (e.g., notice-service):
docker-compose logs -f notice-service

## 6. Restart a Specific Service
docker-compose restart notice-service
